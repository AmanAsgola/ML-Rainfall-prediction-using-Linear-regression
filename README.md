Predicting rainfall is a vital aspect of weather forecasting, agriculture planning, and water resource management. In this project we will use Linear regression algorithm that help establishes relationship between two variables: one dependent (rainfall) and one or more independent variables (e.g., temperature, humidity). It tells us how many inches of rainfall we can expect.
